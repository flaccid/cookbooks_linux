# Official source tarballs can be found at http://znc.in/releases/
# If you want to compile ZNC with OpenSSL support, you need the OpenSSL development package. On Debian/Ubuntu this is called libssl-dev, on CentOS/Fedora/Red Hat it's openssl-devel. 
# Please note that compiling can take 5-10mins or more. 
# See the FAQ page if you encounter problems, http://wiki.znc.in/FAQ

# latest source tarball (at this time) http://znc.in/releases/znc-0.200.tar.gz
