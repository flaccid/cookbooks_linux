= DESCRIPTION:
Installs Zend Framework 1.11.1 and makes it available to apache and/or the CLI.

Also provides some tools for deploying zend framework applications using other Chef repos and cookbooks.

Why not simply install the libzend-framework-php package? Because even on Ubuntu 10.10 it's not the latest version, and
it doesn't add the zend library to php's include_path.  Believe me, I'd rather use a more standard method to install.
